# Harry Potter Quiz

It is a second project that I created for Nikol. She is a tutor who works closely with kids and she gave me the idea to create a quiz for her students.
Harry Potter  has been chosen as it is the most popular book story in the kids' world. Therefore, I thought testing kids' knowledge of this story would be fun.


 The website is live and the link can be found here [Here](https://margaritaatr.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/)

* The user should receive a feedback on wheter the answer is correct or not.
* The user should be able to see a score and have a possibility to restart a quiz.

# `Design:`
 
    I had a few meetings with Nikol, where we discussed a design of the website, questions, images to use and the quiz layout.
    The colourful picture of the Hogward train gives a feeling that there is an adventure waiting for you, and when you press the button "GO", it brings a new image of Hogward school with a foggy effect, making you feel like there is something mysterious within this quiz.

## `Colour scheme:`

The primary colour chosen is rich black with whitesmoke and gold elements, which gives a nice contrast.
 Green colour has been chosen to highlight a correct answer and red to highlight a wrong answer. The bright colours on a black and white background are good for eye-catching.

## `Typography:`
 Times Roman has been used for entire body.
The icons used  for social media links and projects are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/)

## `Imagery:`
