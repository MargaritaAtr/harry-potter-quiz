# Harry Potter Quiz

It is a second project that I created for Nikol. She is a tutor who works closely with kids and she gave me the idea to create a quiz for her students.
Harry Potter  has been chosen as it is the most popular book story in the kids' world. Therefore, I thought testing kids' knowledge of this story would be fun.


 The website is live and the link can be found here [Here](https://margaritaatr.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/)

# `UX`

## `Site Purpose:` 

This website is designed to test users' knowledge of Harry Potter story while listening to the Harry Potter theme song.
The user will get direct feedback on whether he selected the correct or incorrect answer to each question. Once all questions are answered, a message with the score and a "Play again" button will be displayed, encouraging the user to improve his score if he wishes to do so.
 

## `Site Goal:` 

To ensure all questions and answers are relevant, and all functions of the quiz are working.


## `Audience: `
 Everyone who have read or watched Harry Potter story.



## `User goals:`

* The user should be able to test their knowledge of the story.
* The user should have good understanding of the site purpose.
* The user should be able to press a button to start a quiz.
* The user should receive a feedback on wheter the answer is correct or not.
* The user should be able to see a score and have a possibility to restart a quiz.

# `Design:`
 
    I had a few meetings with Nikol, where we discussed a design of the website, questions, images to use and the quiz layout.
    The colourful picture of the Hogward train gives a feeling that there is an adventure waiting for you, and when you press the button "GO", it brings a new image of Hogward school with a foggy effect, making you feel like there is something mysterious within this quiz.

## `Colour scheme:`


![Alt text](/assets/readme-images/colour-pallete.jpeg)

The primary colour chosen is rich black with whitesmoke and gold elements, which gives a nice contrast.
 Green colour has been chosen to highlight a correct answer and red to highlight a wrong answer. The bright colours on a black and white background are good for eye-catching.

<br>

## `Typography:`
 Times Roman has been used for entire body.
The icons used  for social media links and projects are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/)
<br>

## `Imagery:`

The both images of Hogwards Express train and Hogwards school have been taken from [Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com)

# `Existing Features`

## `Welcome page with "GO!" button and instructions`

The background picture of the Welcome page is the Hogwarts Express train. There is a short instruction for the quiz - to make the user aware of what to expect from this website. Also, there is a "GO!" button, which changes a background image, starts the quiz and shows an audio player.

## `Second page with quiz container`

![Alt text](/assets/readme-images/quiz-container.jpeg)

On this screen, there is an invisible container of the quiz so that the user can see a school in the background. The quiz contains ten questions and four options of the answers.

## `Quiz`

![Alt text](/assets/readme-images/quiz.jpeg)

There are four options for the answers to each question. In total, ten questions have been generated in Chat GPT. When the user clicks any answers, a function is set up to highlight the right question in green and the wrong question in red, preventing the user from selecting other options. Also, at the same time, the Next button appears, which enables the user to move to the next question.

## `Audio player`

![Alt text](/assets/readme-images/player.jpeg)

The user can play the theme song while taking the quiz. He can adjust a volume, rewind a song at any time or even turn it off if he does not like it.

## `Display of the score`

![Alt text](/assets/readme-images/score-img.jpeg)

When the user answers all ten questions, it is coded that the score will be displayed with a message. There are three different messages, depending on the score.

## `Icons of social links`
